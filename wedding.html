Bob is in love with Gabriella. Gabriella is in love with Bob. They want to spend the rest of their lives together, and celebrate their commitment to one another in community with you.

        <p>We're celebrating our wedding at <a href="http://woolmanhill.org/trails-and-grounds/">Woolman Hill</a>, a Quaker retreat center up on a hill in the woods of the Pioneer Valley.  We're thrilled to have you celebrate with us.</p>
        
        <p>Bring yourselves, musical instruments, seeds from your garden, and leave behind anything that makes you take yourself too seriously. If you’re planning on hanging around Woolman Hill with us before or after the ceremony--which we hope you are!--don’t forget clothes for mucking around and enjoying the woods.</p>

        <p>Children are very welcome at the wedding. There will be many fun activities for grown ups and little ones alike: giant bubble wands to frolick around the field with, trees to climb, and an arts and crafts table.</p>

        <h3 id="section">Our Story</h3>
        <p>On a crisp September day in 2013, Gabriella and her friend Julie pulled up to 12 Cherry St in a car loaded with boxes. Gabriella had just moved back from Nicaragua, and was grateful to have found a month-to-month lease while she figured out her next step. The house was endearingly obscured by exuberant perennial flowers and overgrown grapevines, reminiscent of the Silvio Rodriguez song, “Mi Casa Ha Sido Tomado Por Las Flores.”</p>

    <h3>Where to Stay?</h3> 
    
            <div>
            <h4>Camping</h4>
            <p>Anyone is welcome to pitch a tent at Woolman Hill! For those of you who are happy to camp, we’d absolutely love to have you stay on site. We and a small group of family and friends will be staying on the hilltop too. Campers will be welcome to use the dorm-style bathroom in the main farmhouse, where we’ll be providing a simple DIY breakfast on Saturday as well as Sunday. Want to camp but don’t have a tent or want to lug yours with you? We’ll have 6 tents available for people to borrow. Please let us know in your RSVP if you want to camp, and if you need to borrow a tent.</p>

    <h3>Our Registry</h3>
        
    <p>We've made a registry to give you some gift ideas, but we like surprises too. We would love handwritten cards, seeds from your garden, or any gifts that come with a story. Our biggest material wish is to find a house, and would appreciate any way that you can contribute towards it.  And please know that your presence at our wedding and in our lives is a gift in and of itself.
