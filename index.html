                        <p>The mismatch problem for consequentialism arises whenever the theory delivers mismatched verdicts between a group act and the individual acts that compose it. A natural thought is that moving to expected utility versions of consequentialism will solve this problem. I explain why the move to expected utility is not successful.</p>

                        <p>There’s a familiar problem for consequentialism that arises in connection with anthropogenic climate change: it seems as though someone has misbehaved, but if no individual makes a difference, then it’s not clear how to assign wrongdoing. Several philosophers have suggested an intuitive solution. The idea is to assign disutility to a group act and then distribute a share of this disutility to each of the participants. Unfortunately, the idea hasn’t been developed in a satisfactory way. I identify several difficulties for the approach, and I explain why I don’t think the approach can be made to work.</p>

                        <p>The mismatch problem for consequentialism arises whenever the theory delivers mismatched verdicts between a group act and the individual acts that compose it. Several philosophers have suggested that the problem can be resolved by modifying consequentialism in order to condemn uncooperativeness. As I explain in this paper, this strategy does not succeed as a general solution to the problem. There are versions of the problem case that do not involve uncooperative individuals.</p>
